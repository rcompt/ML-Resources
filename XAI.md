# Weld & Bansal (2018) The Challenge of Crafting Intelligible Intelligence

Most computer-based produced behavior is alien (can fail in unexpected ways). Complex systems that exceeds human abilities to verify. We can neither trust nor control system behavior that we do not understand. 

Seek AI systems that:
1. it is clear what factors caused the system's action, allowing users to predict how changes to the situation would have led to alternative behaviors
2. permits effective control of the AI by enabling interaction

# Modeling Procedure
## Data Splitting

### Even splitting across data sets
Need to ensure that data is not split such that each split contains varying distributions of classes and features
-Stratified sampling is good for class
Stratified sampling is the procedure in which a representative distribution of the target is present across all train, validation, and test data sets.

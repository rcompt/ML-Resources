# Distributions

Probability distributions indicate the likelihood of an event or outcome. 

p(x) = the likelihood that random variable takes a specific value of x

The sum of all probabilities for all possible values must equal 1. Furthermore, the probability for a particular value or range of values must be between 0 and 1.

Probability distributions describe the dispersion of the values of a random variable. 

The kind of variable determines the type of probability distribution.

## Discrete 
Discrete probability functions are also known as probability mass functions and can assume a discrete number of values. 
Examples:
-Coin Tosses
-Counts of Events

### Uniform
Model multiple events with the same probability, such as rolling a die

### Binomial 
Model binary data, such as coin tosses or win-loss records

### Poisson
Model count data, such as the count of library book checkouts per hour

## Continuous
Continuous probability functions are also known as probability density functions. You know that you have a continuous distribution if the variable can assume an infinite number of values between any two values. Continuous variables are often measurements on a scale, such as height, weight, and temperature.

Unlike discrete probability distributions where each particular value has a non-zero likelihood, specific values in continuous distributions have a zero probability. For example, the likelihood of measuring a temperature that is exactly 32 degrees is zero. *** Double check this fact with other sources (May have to do with integrations as they return 0 is the bounds of the integral are equal... if I remember correctly).
